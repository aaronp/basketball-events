/**
 * Write a utility that:
 * • can parse incoming data items into a data structure suitable for capturing the state of the match
 * • maintains a match state as additional data items are received. It should be possible to query
 * the match state (via a method) for the following:
 * ◦ the last event (i.e. which team last scored, how many points, at what point through the
 * match and what the resulting match score was)
 * ◦ the last n events (where 0 <= n <= Total Items)
 * ◦ all events in the match so far
 * • handles cases where an invalid data item is received or where data is inconsistent with previous data received.
